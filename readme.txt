exampleActScreen01

This is a replica of the Add Activity Screen from the whatSticksKivy08 app. The sizing for each widget comes from in side the size_dict.csv and get's converted to the dictionary inside size_dict.py. This uses http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm to convert the csv files to json.
